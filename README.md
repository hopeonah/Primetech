In my individual analysis, I examined a 3D artefact on Michael Collins. My role was to touch on the artefact requirements, methods, and testing, the main Goals, and lastly our initial expectations.
  We wanted to assess the artefact by using apps such as MeshMorph and Sketchfab to scan the artefact, and we wanted to see what we could improve on and what was affordable to scan the artefact. This artefact caught our attention due to the Irish historical background it had. We are using the artefact for our scanning tools because we agreed as a group that it would be more effective, it allowed us to highlight the 3d artefact with different scanning apps due to each individual's practicality, and also being able also to evaluate digital modification and details, we also decided on text instead of audio because we believed that it would easily gain the users attention also help them to navigate the 3d object better. We agreed on the Michael Collins artefact because it scanned better than the other artefacts that we tried out. For example, the other artefact that we tested out was the woman statue in UCC it didn’t have the best result due to dark areas not being recognised. 
My contribution to the assignment was to focus on the main goals and expectations. This allowed me to highlight the scanning process and help contribute apart of the group's final results.
The implementation of how it worked and how successful we were in achieving our research goal was that we scanned the 3d artefact multiple times with trial and error, we also assessed the affordability and effective resources. We wanted to test the limitations of its applications. After multiple trials and errors, the 3d artefact was successfully exported in OBJ, STL, and GLB formats. Overall few adjustments could have been made, such as angle adjustments, lighting changes, and increased precision.
